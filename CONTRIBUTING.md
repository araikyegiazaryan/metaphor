# Contributing to Metaphor

Looking to contribute something to Metaphor? **Here's how you can help.**

We love making super awesome stuff, but even more we like to empower people to make changes on their own. Feel free to fork and improve Metaphor.
Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits within the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of any new features. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Code guidelines

### HTML

[Adhere to the Code Guide.](http://codeguide.co/#html)

- Use tags and elements appropriate for an HTML5 doctype (e.g., self-closing tags).
- Use CDNs and HTTPS for third-party JS when possible. We don't use protocol-relative URLs in this case because they break when viewing the page locally via `file://`.
- Use [WAI-ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) attributes in documentation examples to promote accessibility.

### CSS

[Adhere to the Code Guide.](http://codeguide.co/#css)

- When feasible, default color palettes should comply with [WCAG color contrast guidelines](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast).
- Except in rare cases, don't remove default `:focus` styles (via e.g. `outline: none;`) without providing alternative styles. See [this A11Y Project post](http://a11yproject.com/posts/never-remove-css-outlines/) for more details.
